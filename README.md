# Rustify

Rustify is a fast and simple command-line tool that **sorts and organizes files** in a given directory  
based on file **extensions** and predefined **categories** (e.g., images, documents, audio, video, etc).

Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), using `clap`, `walkdir`, and `std::fs`.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ixand/rustify.git
   cd rustify
   ```

2. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the binary**:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/rustify /path/to/your/folder
   ```

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
rustify <DIRECTORY> [OPTIONS]
```

* `DIRECTORY`: The path to the folder you want to organize.
* `OPTIONS`:

  * `--dry-run`: Show what would be moved, without making changes.

### Examples

```bash
rustify ~/Downloads
rustify ~/Downloads --dry-run
```

This will scan your `Downloads` folder and move files into subfolders like:

```
Downloads/
â”œâ”€â”€ Images/
â”œâ”€â”€ Documents/
â”œâ”€â”€ Audio/
â”œâ”€â”€ Video/
â”œâ”€â”€ Archives/
â”œâ”€â”€ Code/
â”œâ”€â”€ Other/
```

Each category is based on file extensions.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Rustify uses predefined file extension mappings to group files into categories:

* `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif` â†’ `Images/`
* `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt` â†’ `Documents/`
* `.mp3`, `.wav` â†’ `Audio/`
* `.mp4`, `.avi` â†’ `Video/`
* `.zip`, `.tar.gz` â†’ `Archives/`
* `.rs`, `.py`, `.js` â†’ `Code/`
* Unknown types â†’ `Other/`

---

## ðŸ›  Features

* Cross-platform (Linux, Windows)
* Fast and lightweight
* Safe: creates folders and moves files without deleting anything
* Supports **dry-run mode** (`--dry-run`): preview what will be moved without making any changes
* Open source

---

## ðŸ”® Future Plans

* Configurable file type mappings (`config.toml`)
* Recursive subfolder support (optional)
* Logging and reporting
